<!--  Setup: Create a new HTML file in VS Code and name the file "[first name]-[last-name]-functions-1.html". The file should have only a default HTML structure. Title the webpage "JavaScript Functions Exercise 1".


Instructions: Within the body, create a script tag and write JavaScript code to do the following:

1. Define a function called "greet" that takes a single parameter, "name", and prints "Hello, [name]!" to the console.
2. Define a function called "add" that takes two parameters, "num1" and "num2", and returns their sum.
3. Call the "greet" function, passing your name as an argument.
4. Call the "add" function, passing two numbers as arguments, and print the result to the console.
5. Verify that your code works by running it and checking the output to the console in either VS Code or in your web browser's developer console.  -->
